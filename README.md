# Deep neural net - Robot navigation

The Deep Learning Winter School took place at the University of Hull in January 2019. Tailored towards undergraduate and postgradudate students as well as advanced pupils and prospective students who wish to get involved with the exciting research field of deep learning.

A competition was held in which groups were assigned to solve an issue and present their work to an audience; the project that was assigned to my group was to navigate a robot. We used a deep neural network to reduce error in the navigation of our robot. We managed to get a high of 96.48% accuracy.
