The Deep Learning Winter School took place at the University of Hull in January 2019. They were tailored towards undergraduate and postgradudate students as well as advanced pupils and prospective students who wish to get involved with the exciting research field of deep learning.

The 2-day events were designed as a hands-on introduction to the theory and practice of deep learning - the driving technology behind recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence, such as self-diriving cars, personal assistants, autonomous drones and machine translation, amongst many others. Knowledge of deep learning and experience in applying it are increasingly sought after skills for graduates, both in industry and academia.

This project was assigned to my group of which we created a deep neural network to help reduce error in navigation of a robot. Managed to get a high of 96.48% accuracy.
